Revision history for Perl module CLDR::Number

v0.04 2014-01-21
 - Implement currency spacing rules from CLDR spec: when a non-symbol character
   in the currency sign would touch a digit, add a space between them,
   e.g. CHF 1.99 instead of CHF1.99 [github #7]
 - Use private-use characters U+F8F0–U+F8F4 internally as placeholders,
   which makes them unavailable for use in patterns and signs [github #24]
 - Add private module CLDR::Number::Constant to provide internal placeholder
   variables [github #25]
